## When to Use

- User wants to create a podcast episode on any topic
- User provides a URL or text and wants it turned into a podcast discussion
- User asks for a "debate", "dialogue", or "discussion" format
- User says "podcast", "播客", or "录一期节目"

## When NOT to Use

- User wants text-to-speech reading (use `/speech`)
- User wants an explainer video with visuals (use `/explainer`)
- User wants to generate an image (use `/image-gen`)
- User only wants to extract content from a URL without generating audio (use `/content-parser`)

## Purpose

Generate podcast episodes with 1-2 AI speakers discussing a topic. Supports quick overviews, deep analysis, and debate formats. Input can be a topic description, URL(s), or text. Output is a full audio episode with transcript.

## Hard Constraints

- No shell scripts. Construct curl commands from the API reference files listed in Resources
- Always read `shared/authentication.md` for API key and headers
- Follow `shared/common-patterns.md` for polling, errors, and interaction patterns
- Never hardcode speaker IDs in API calls — use built-in defaults from `shared/speaker-selection.md` as fallback only; fetch from the speakers API when the user wants to change voice
- Never fabricate API endpoints or parameters
- Always read config following `shared/config-pattern.md` before any interaction
- Always follow `shared/speaker-selection.md` for speaker selection (text table + free-text input)
- Never save files to `~/Downloads/` or `.listenhub/` — save artifacts to the current working directory with friendly topic-based names (see `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming)

<HARD-GATE>
Use the AskUserQuestion tool for every multiple-choice step — do NOT print options as plain text. Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding to the next step. After all parameters are collected, summarize the choices and ask the user to confirm. Do NOT call any generation API until the user has explicitly confirmed.

</HARD-GATE>

## Step -1: API Key Check

Follow `shared/config-pattern.md` § API Key Check. If the key is missing, stop immediately.

## Step 0: Config Setup

Follow `shared/config-pattern.md` Step 0 (Zero-Question Boot).

**If file doesn't exist** — silently create with defaults and proceed:
```bash
mkdir -p ".listenhub/podcast"
echo '{"outputMode":"inline","language":null,"defaultMode":"quick","defaultMethod":"one-step","defaultSpeakers":{}}' > ".listenhub/podcast/config.json"
CONFIG_PATH=".listenhub/podcast/config.json"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```
**Do NOT ask any setup questions.** Proceed directly to the Interaction Flow.

**If file exists** — read config silently and proceed:
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=".listenhub/podcast/config.json"
[ ! -f "$CONFIG_PATH" ] && CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.listenhub/podcast/config.json"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```

### Setup Flow (user-initiated reconfigure only)

Only run when the user explicitly asks to reconfigure. Display current settings:
```
当前配置 (podcast)：
  输出方式：{inline / download / both}
  语言偏好：{zh / en / 未设置}
  默认模式：{quick / deep / debate / 未设置}
  默认生成方式：{one-step / two-step}
  默认主播：{speakerName(s) / 使用内置默认}
```

Then ask these questions in order and save:

1. **outputMode**: Follow `shared/output-mode.md` § Setup Flow Question.

2. **Language** (optional): "默认语言？"
   - "中文 (zh)"
   - "English (en)"
   - "每次手动选择" → keep `null`

3. **Mode** (optional): "默认播客模式？"
   - "Quick — 简短概述"
   - "Deep — 深度分析"
   - "Debate — 辩论对话"
   - "每次手动选择" → keep `null`

4. **Method** (optional): "默认生成方式？"
   - "一步生成（推荐）" → `defaultMethod: "one-step"`
   - "两步生成（先预览文本）" → `defaultMethod: "two-step"`
   - "每次手动选择" → keep `null`

After collecting answers, save immediately:
```bash
NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq --arg m "$OUTPUT_MODE" '. + {"outputMode": $m}')
# Save language if user chose one (not "每次手动选择")
if [ "$LANGUAGE" != "null" ]; then
  NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$NEW_CONFIG" | jq --arg lang "$LANGUAGE" '. + {"language": $lang}')
fi
# Save mode if user chose one
if [ "$MODE" != "null" ]; then
  NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$NEW_CONFIG" | jq --arg mode "$MODE" '. + {"defaultMode": $mode}')
fi
# Save method if user chose one
if [ "$METHOD" != "null" ]; then
  NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$NEW_CONFIG" | jq --arg method "$METHOD" '. + {"defaultMethod": $method}')
fi
echo "$NEW_CONFIG" > "$CONFIG_PATH"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```

## Interaction Flow

### Step 1: Topic + Reference Materials

Ask topic and optional reference materials **together in a single question** using AskUserQuestion with two sub-questions, or a single free-text prompt:

> What topic would you like to turn into a podcast? If you have reference materials (URLs or text), include them here too.

Accept: topic description, URL(s), pasted text, or any combination.

Examples of valid input:
- "AI developments in 2026"
- "https://example.com/article — discuss this"
- "The pros and cons of remote work. Reference: https://study.com/remote-work-2026"

### Step 2: Mode

**Default: "quick"** — skip this question unless:
- `config.defaultMode` is set to something else → use that value silently
- User explicitly mentioned a mode keyword in Step 1 (e.g. "deep dive", "debate", "in depth") → infer mode from intent

Only ask this question if the user's intent is ambiguous AND no default is configured. In most cases, just use "quick".

### Step 3: Language

**Default: match the user's interaction language.** Detect from the language the user used in Step 1:
- If the user wrote in Chinese → `zh`
- If the user wrote in English → `en`
- If `config.language` is set → use that value

**Never ask this question.** Always infer silently. Show in the confirmation summary so the user can override if needed.

### Step 4: Speaker Count

**Default: 2 speakers (dialogue)** — the most common and engaging format.

Skip this question. Debate mode requires 2 speakers. For quick/deep, default to 2 speakers as well.

Only use 1 speaker if the user explicitly requests a monologue or solo format.

### Step 5: Speaker Selection

Follow `shared/speaker-selection.md`:
- If `config.defaultSpeakers.{language}` is set → use saved speakers silently
- If not set → use **built-in defaults** from `shared/speaker-selection.md` (no question asked)
- Show the speaker(s) in the confirmation summary — user can change from there if desired
- Only show the full speaker list if the user explicitly asks to change voices

For 2-speaker mode (dialogue/debate): use Primary + Secondary defaults for the language.

### Step 6: Generation Method

**Default: "one-step"** — skip this question unless:
- `config.defaultMethod` is set → use that value silently
- User explicitly asks to review text first → use "two-step"

### Step 7: Confirm & Generate

Summarize all choices:

```
Ready to generate podcast:

  Topic: {topic}
  Mode: {mode}
  Language: {language}
  Speakers: {speaker name(s)}
  References: {yes/no + brief description}
  Method: {one-step/two-step}

  Proceed?
```

Wait for explicit confirmation before calling any API. The user can adjust any parameter here before confirming.

## Workflow

### One-Step Generation

1. **Submit (foreground)**: `POST /podcast/episodes` with collected parameters → extract `episodeId`
2. Tell the user the task is submitted
3. **Poll (background)**: Run the following **exact** bash command with `run_in_background: true` and `timeout: 600000`. Do NOT use python3, awk, or any other JSON parser — use `jq` as shown:

   ```bash
   EPISODE_ID="<id-from-step-1>"
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do
     RESULT=$(curl -sS "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/podcast/episodes/$EPISODE_ID" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
       -H "X-Source: skills" 2>/dev/null)
     STATUS=$(echo "$RESULT" | tr -d '\000-\037\177' | jq -r '.data.processStatus // "pending"')
     case "$STATUS" in
       success|completed) echo "$RESULT"; exit 0 ;;
       failed|error) echo "FAILED: $RESULT" >&2; exit 1 ;;
       *) sleep 10 ;;
     esac
   done
   echo "TIMEOUT" >&2; exit 2
   ```
4. When notified of completion, **Step 6: Present result**

   Read `OUTPUT_MODE` from config. Follow `shared/output-mode.md` for behavior.

   **`inline` or `both`**: Display `audioUrl` as a clickable link.

   Present:
   ```
   播客已生成！

   在线收听：{audioUrl}
   字幕：{subtitlesUrl}（如有）
   时长：{audioDuration / 1000}s
   消耗积分：{credits}
   ```

   **`download` or `both`**: Also download the file. Generate a topic slug following `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming.
   ```bash
   SLUG="{topic-slug}"  # e.g. "ai-developments"
   NAME="${SLUG}-podcast.mp3"
   # Dedup: if file exists, append -2, -3, etc.
   BASE="${NAME%.*}"; EXT="${NAME##*.}"; i=2
   while [ -e "$NAME" ]; do NAME="${BASE}-${i}.${EXT}"; i=$((i+1)); done
   curl -sS -o "$NAME" "{audioUrl}"
   ```
   Present:
   ```
   已保存到当前目录：
     {NAME}
   ```
5. Offer to show transcript or provide download URL on request

### Two-Step Generation

1. **Step 1 — Submit text (foreground)**: `POST /podcast/episodes/text-content` → extract `episodeId`
2. **Poll text (background)**: Use the exact `jq`-based polling loop above (substitute endpoint `podcast/episodes/text-content/{episodeId}` if needed), with `run_in_background: true` and `timeout: 600000`
3. When notified, **save draft to a topic-based folder in cwd**:
   - Generate a topic slug following `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming
   - Create `{slug}-podcast/` folder (dedup if exists)
   - Write `draft.md` (human-readable: `**{speakerName}**: {content}` per line)
   - Write `draft.json` (raw `scripts` array)
   - Present the draft location and content preview
4. **STOP**: Present the draft and wait for explicit user approval
5. **Step 2 — Submit audio (foreground, after approval)**:
   - No changes: `POST /podcast/episodes/{episodeId}/audio` with `{}`
   - With edits: `POST /podcast/episodes/{episodeId}/audio` with modified `{scripts: [...]}`
6. **Poll audio (background)**: Same exact `jq`-based loop, `run_in_background: true`, `timeout: 600000`
7. When notified, **download audio to the same folder**:
   - `curl -sS -o {slug}-podcast/podcast.mp3 {audioUrl}`
   - Present final result (same format as one-step, folder now has draft + final files)

### After Successful Generation

Update config with the choices made this session:

```bash
NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq \
  --arg lang "{language}" \
  --arg mode "{mode}" \
  --arg method "{one-step/two-step}" \
  --argjson speakers '{"{language}": ["{speakerId}"]}' \
  '. + {"language": $lang, "defaultMode": $mode, "defaultMethod": $method, "defaultSpeakers": (.defaultSpeakers + $speakers)}')
echo "$NEW_CONFIG" > "$CONFIG_PATH"
```

## API Reference

- Speaker list: `shared/api-speakers.md`
- Speaker selection guide: `shared/speaker-selection.md`
- Episode creation: `shared/api-podcast.md`
- Polling: `shared/common-patterns.md` § Async Polling
- Config pattern: `shared/config-pattern.md`

## Composability

- **Invokes**: speakers API (for speaker selection)
- **Invoked by**: content-planner (Phase 3)

## Example

**User**: "Make a podcast about the latest AI developments"

**Agent workflow**:
1. Detect: podcast request, topic = "latest AI developments", no references
2. Infer: mode = "quick" (default), language = "en" (user wrote in English), 2 speakers (default), one-step (default)
3. Show confirmation summary → user confirms

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/podcast/episodes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Source: skills" \
  -d '{
    "sources": [{"type": "text", "content": "The latest AI developments"}],
    "speakers": [{"speakerId": "cozy-man-english"}],
    "language": "en",
    "mode": "deep"
  }'
```

Poll until complete, then present the result with title and listen link.
